- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kixzy

- 👀 Right now, I am just a not-giving-up web developer who is dealing with the toxicity of JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently building Projects with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also learning ReactJS and every other stuff I pickup from peoples Tweets. 😇 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on junior developer projects. And intern for someone or a company. I just need this to boost my confidence and learn the everyday work life of a developer.
- 💞️ I’m a kindhearted, nice guy with a good sense of humour. I smile all the time, and I love to be efficient with my work. I know you are not here to know about my smile and kindheartedness, but you're here for my portfolio and resources. I just thought it will be nice and do no harm for us to get acquainted.😁😅 You know, share some laughter, and click well. I have a great feeling that we might just get to work together. 😇 I am always optimistic.

- 💾 I am proud to say that I do have some works to myname;, please feel free to check them on my Portfolio. Oops, 🙊 I don't have that yet. But trust me, I will create one soon. However, I have gracefully completed these challenges on Frontend Mentor, which I think shows my continuous progress. Please check them out https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Kixzy
