- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kixzy

- 👀 Right now, I am just A-not-giving-up web developer who is dealing with the toxicity of JavaScript. 
- 🌱 I’m currently building Projects with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also Learnnig ReactJS and every other stuff I pickup from peoples Tweets. 😇 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Junior Developer Projects. And Intern for Someone or a company. I just need this to boost my confidence and learn the everyday work life of a Developer.
- 💞️ I’m a kindhearted, nice guy with a good sense of humour. I smile all the time and I love to be effiecient with my work. I know you are not here to know about my smile and kindheartedness but you're here for my porfolio and respositories. I just thought it will be nice and no harm for us to get acquainted.😁😅 You know, share some laughter and click well. I have a great feeling that we might just get to work together. 😇 I am always Optimistic.

- 💾 I am proud to say that I do have some works to my noble name, please feel free to check them on my Portfolio. ooops 🙊 I don't have that yet. But trust me I will create one soon. However, I have gracefully completed these challenges on Frontend Mentor which I think shows my continious progress. Please you check them out https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Kixzy
